## OMDB Parser

This is the OMDB Parser.

## Before you start

1. Download the file: `title.basics.tsv.gz` from [IMDB](https://datasets.imdbws.com/).
2. Get an API key at [omdbapi](https://www.omdbapi.com/)

What is it doing?

* Read OMDB database file and apply some filters passed as program flags;
* With the filters results a query to OMDB API to get the plot of each movie;
* Once the movie is found a result if showed as below:
```
IMDB_ID     |   Title               |   Plot
tt0000005   |   Blacksmith Scene    |   Three men hammer on an anvil and pass a bottle of beer around. 
```
* if the program is still running and the `maxRunTime` threshold is reached, 
the program will print any results and gracefully exit;
* the program will gracefully exit with no output when stopped with `SIGTERM`;
* If the API Key is not be informed an error message will be shown:
```
You must provide an API Key in the "apiKey" Flag
```
* If the request API limit were reached the following message will be shown:
```
URL: [http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=<APIKEY>&&t=&i=tt0002406&plot=short&type=&y=]
Request limit reached! - Unauthorized
